# Learning React.js and Connecting to Json Server

This is one of my first projects while I'am learning React.js, simply I used to get data from json server and post to it.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000`

Launches the json server that carries the data of the blogs, once the server run you can get, post and delete blogs data.
